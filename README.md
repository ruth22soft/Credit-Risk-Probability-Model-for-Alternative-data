## Credit Scoring Business Understanding

### How does the Basel II Accord’s emphasis on risk measurement influence our need for an interpretable and well-documented model?

The Basel II Accord sets international standards for banking regulations, emphasizing the importance of accurately measuring credit risk to ensure that financial institutions hold sufficient capital reserves against potential loan losses. This regulatory framework requires credit scoring models to be transparent, interpretable, and thoroughly documented. 

An interpretable model allows stakeholders—including regulators, risk officers, and auditors—to understand how risk assessments are made. This transparency is crucial for validating the model’s decisions and ensuring it meets regulatory compliance. Well-documented models provide a clear trail of the model development process, assumptions, and methodologies, which supports auditability and ongoing monitoring. Without these qualities, models risk being rejected by regulators or failing to identify risks properly, potentially leading to financial instability.

### Since we lack a direct "default" label, why is creating a proxy variable necessary, and what are the potential business risks of making predictions based on this proxy?

In this project, the dataset does not include an explicit "default" label indicating whether a customer has failed to meet their loan obligations. Therefore, creating a proxy variable becomes necessary to approximate credit risk using alternative behavioral indicators, such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) metrics derived from transaction data.

This proxy serves as a stand-in target variable for training predictive models. However, relying on a proxy introduces certain business risks:

- **Misclassification Risk:** The proxy may not perfectly capture true default behavior, leading to false positives (customers incorrectly labeled as high risk) or false negatives (high-risk customers not identified).
- **Decision Impact:** Incorrect risk assessments can result in denying credit to creditworthy customers or extending credit to risky ones, affecting profitability and customer relationships.
- **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Since the proxy is an indirect measure, regulators may require additional validation to ensure the model's reliability.

Despite these risks, proxy variables are essential when direct default data is unavailable, enabling the development of actionable credit scoring models.

### What are the key trade-offs between using a simple, interpretable model (like Logistic Regression with WoE) versus a complex, high-performance model (like Gradient Boosting) in a regulated financial context?

In a regulated financial environment, the choice between simple and complex models involves balancing interpretability, performance, and compliance:

- **Simple Models (Logistic Regression with WoE):**
  - **Pros:** Highly interpretable, easy to explain to stakeholders and regulators. WoE transformation improves feature monotonicity and model stability. Easier to validate and document.
  - **Cons:** May have limited ability to capture complex nonlinear relationships, potentially resulting in lower predictive accuracy.

- **Complex Models (Gradient Boosting):**
  - **Pros:** Typically deliver superior predictive performance by capturing intricate patterns and interactions in the data.
  - **Cons:** Often considered “black boxes” due to low interpretability. Harder to explain decisions, which can be a barrier for regulatory approval. Requires more extensive validation and monitoring.

The trade-off means that while complex models can improve risk prediction, they may increase regulatory and operational challenges. Financial institutions often prefer simpler models for initial deployment and may use complex models as complementary tools with explainability techniques.
